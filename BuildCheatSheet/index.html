        <h3>Introduction to Color</h3>
        <p>CSS supports a wide variety of colors. 
           Named colors, like blue, black, or limegreen, as well as
           numeric values. Using the numeric system allows us to 
           take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that
           browsers support. </p>

                                    The hex number system has 16 digits (0 - 15). To represent 10-15, we use A-F.

                                represents the amount of red, the second is green, and the third
                                is blue. These colors are exactly the same as hex, but with a
                                different syntax and a different number system.

                            <td>The first number represents the degree of the
                                hue, and can be between 0 and 360. The second
                                and third numbers are percentages representing
                                saturation and lightness respectively.
                                <div>Hue is the first number. It refers to an
                                    angle on a color wheel. Red is 0 degrees, 
                                    Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, 
                                    and then back to Red at 360.
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    Saturation refers to the intensity or purity 
                                    of the color. The saturation increases 
                                    towards 100% as the color becomes richer. 
                                    The saturation decreases towards 0% as the 
                                    color becomes grayer.
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    Lightness refers to how light or dark the color 
                                    is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. 
                                    Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light switch that 
                                    starts halfway. Sliding the dimmer up towards 
                                    100% makes the color lighter, closer to white. 
                                    Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the 
                                    color darker, closer to black.
                                </div>
                            </td>
                            <td>This is the color <span style="color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);">green</span> in HSL</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>color: hsla(x, x%, x%, x);</td>
                            <td>Opacity and Alpha</td>
                            <td>To use opacity in the HSL color scheme, 
                                use hsla instead of hsl, and four values instead 
                                of three.
                                <div>
                                    The first three values work the same as hsl. 
                                    The fourth value (which we have not seen before) 
                                    is the alpha. This last value is sometimes called 
                                    opacity.
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, 
                                    rgba. Again, the first three values work the same as rgb 
                                    and the last value is the alpha.
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    Alpha can only be used with HSL, RGB, and hex colors; we 
                                    cannot add the alpha value to name colors like green.
                                </div>
                            </td>
                            <td>this is the color <span style="color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.5);">brown</span> with 50% opacity</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
